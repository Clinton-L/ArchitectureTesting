MEDIATOR PATTERN
// Improve from 1-1 to many-many-ish--DONE
// Add a relationship datasctructure (to help with above)--DONE
// -> This datastructure could also have a func built into it e.g. moisture sensor => Send to wiper mech--DONE
// tuple switch C#8--NOT NEEDED
// Multiple mediators?--EASILY IMPLEMENTED

BUILDER PATTERN
/*
* Notes:
* Add another builder (Slab builder and House builder)
* Add director (Site manager controlling order of build)
* Add Multiple houses being built (with dependancy)
*/

ABSTRACT FACTORY
/*
* Once we implemented the abstarct factories and abstract products, it did not seem likely we would extand our learning with further extensions.
* Could just be because its a creational pattern
* Would be better making another.
* Perhaps have Abstarct Products interact with other Factories to create Super Products?
